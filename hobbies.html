      <li>“Damn shame. I tell you... being a black woman. Be strong, they say. Support your man,
        raise your man, think like a man. Well damn, I gotta do all that? Who’s out here working for me,
        carrying my burden, building me up when I get down? Nobody. Black women out here trying to save
        everybody and what do we get? Swagger jacked by white girls wearing cornrows and bamboo earrings.
        Ain’t that a bitch? But we still try. Try to help all y’all. Even when we get nothing. Is that
        admirable or ridiculous? I don’t know.” – <a href="https://youtu.be/rVT0jIWylgc">Mama Pope</a></li>

        extraordinary love.” – <a href="https://youtu.be/I1EAu65DhZg">Olivia Pope</a></li>
      <li>“Olivia, he would hurt you. Your father? He would slit your throat and drink your blood if it
        served the Republic.” – <a href="https://youtu.be/nMn3BZueHZg">Jake Ballard</a>
